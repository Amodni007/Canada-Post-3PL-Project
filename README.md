# Canada-Post-3PL-Project
Business Analyst project: SLA design, KPI tracking, and Power BI dashboards for logistics.
# 📦 Canada Post Courier Growth Partnership – Data-Driven 3PL Strategy

## 🧠 Overview
This project was developed as part of a strategic consulting initiative to enhance Canada Post’s intercity parcel delivery capabilities through data-driven 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) partnerships.

As a **Business Analyst**, I used tools like **Excel** and **Power BI** to analyze market trends, delivery performance, and customer preferences. The outcome was a comprehensive plan for optimizing delivery efficiency, expanding coverage, and improving service reliability via private courier partnerships.
